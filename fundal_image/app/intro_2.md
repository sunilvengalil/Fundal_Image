The goal of this project  is to come up with efficient techniques for fundus image analysis and build an end to end tool that can help to carry out the following analysis.  
1. Image quality assessment. This module checks whether the image is of  diagnostic  quality or not. Poor quality images from which diagnostic is not possible are not processed by the upstream modules. 
2. Segmentation of various structures like blood vessels, optic disc and macula
3. Segmentation of various abnormalities like Exudates, Hemorrhages and Microaneurysms (In Progress)
4. Detection of diseases Diabetic Retinopathy and Glaucoma (Future)
