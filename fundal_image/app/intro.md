# Fundus Image Analysis
[Fundus image](https://www.opsweb.org/page/fundusimaging) (also known as retinal image)  is the most widely used non-invasive (non-surgical) approach for diagnosis of various eye diseases and cardio-vascular diseases.

According to WHO, there are 2.2 billion people with vision impairment of which 1 billion cases could have been prevented if proper attention was paid. This clearly shows that the number of ophthalmologic experts is far below the number of patients who need attention.  Automatic analysis  and diagnosis tools can be of great help to fill this gap by automating screening of patients and automatic diagnostic tools that can help the productivity of an ophthalmologist.

The goal of this project  is to come up with efficient techniques for fundus image analysis and build an end to end tool that can help to carry out the following analysis. 
1. Image quality assessment. This module checks whether the image is of  diagnostic  quality or not. Poor quality images from which diagnostic is not possible are not processed by the upstream modules.
2. Segmentation of various structures like blood vessels, optic disc and macula.
3. Segmentation of various abnormalities like Exudates, Hemorrhages and Microaneurysms (In Progress).
4. Detection of diseases like Diabetic Retinopathy and Glaucoma (Future).
